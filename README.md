# geneticalgoimg
A genetic algorithm which takes in a target image and, with randomly generated individuals, tries to create something as close as possible to target image, via crossovers and mutations.
an individual, in this case, is a simple 28x28 bmp file, but you can use any resolution, if you decide on using this (heads up: larger resolutions will take a longer time to run).
the 'out' directoy contains the output of the algorithm: the best individual from every generation (best = closest to target).
